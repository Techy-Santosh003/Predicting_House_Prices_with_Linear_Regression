# Predicting_House_Prices_with_Linear_Regression
In this project, I applied linear regression techniques to predict house prices. Here are the key aspects and achievements:
Data Collection: Obtained a dataset with numerical features and a target variable for prediction.
Data Exploration and Cleaning: Explored the dataset to understand its structure, handled missing values, and ensured data quality.
Feature Selection: Identified relevant features that contribute to the predictive model.
Model Training: Implemented linear regression using Scikit-Learn.
Model Evaluation: Assessed the model's performance on a separate test dataset using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R²).

Key Metrics:
MAE: 970,043.40
MSE: 1,754,318,687,330.67
RMSE: 1,324,506.96
R²: 0.65

Visualization: Created visualizations to illustrate the relationship between predicted and actual values, providing clear insights into model performance.
